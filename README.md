# Bare_Metal_Driver_Development

This project focuses on developing peripheral drivers from scratch for ARM Cortex-M4 based microcontrollers without relying on any third-party libraries. 

## Project Goals
- Implement GPIO, UART, I2C, and SPI drivers
- Bare-metal programming principles
- Direct register-level programming

## Target Hardware
- STM32F407VG (ARM Cortex-M4)

## Development Environment
- STM32CubeIDE
- GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain (GCC)

## Folder Structure
- `/Core` : Startup files and system initialization
- `/Drivers` : Peripheral drivers (GPIO, UART, I2C, SPI)
- `/Examples` : Example applications demonstrating driver usage
- `/Docs` : Documentation and architecture explanations
